# Task management API
### Overview
Welcome to the Task Management API, a robust solution built with Django and Django REST Framework (DRF). This API provides comprehensive functionalities for task creation, updates, deletion, and status management. Itâ€™s designed to streamline your workflow, with features like task categorization, collaboration, and recurrence. Secure, token-based authentication (JWT) ensures that your data remains protected. The API is deployed on Heroku, guaranteeing reliable access.
